My goal is an in browser python editor I can embed into a blog.

Code is ran client side, so don't try to crash any server or anything like that.

```{=html}
<div class="col fragment" data-fragment-index="2"
                        style="height: min(30vw, 60vh); margin: min(1vw, 2vh)">
                        <python-editor contenteditable="true" theme="dark" code="elements = [39,12,18,85,72,10,2,18]

print('Unsorted list is\n', elements)

# Sort the list (with bubblesort)
for n in range(len(elements)-1, 0, -1):
  for i in range(n):
    if elements[i] > elements[i+1]:
      elements[i], elements[i+1] = elements[i+1], elements[i]

print('\nSorted list is\n', elements)" />
                    </div>
```


Awww, the input function doesn't seem to work. 


Shift + enter/return to evaluate code of the below. 

```{=html}
<py-repl></py-repl>
```

This kinda works, but also has issues. Input fucntion still doesn't work. 


Shift + enter/return to evaluate below.

```{=html}
<pyprez-editor>
   import numpy as np
   np.random.rand(5)
</pyprez-editor>
```

This is cool, but the code isn't editable. It just resets itself for some reason.
